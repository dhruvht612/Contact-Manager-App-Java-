# 📇 Contact Manager App

> A Java-based contact management system that allows users to store, manage, sort, and search for personal or professional contacts using efficient algorithms and clean object-oriented design principles.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Contact Manager App** is a command-line Java application designed for learning and showcasing skills in:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Modular code architecture

This project demonstrates real-world use of inheritance, encapsulation, and data manipulation — perfect for portfolios or coursework.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new contacts (with multiple addresses)
- 🔍 Search by full name using **Binary Search**
- 🔎 Partial name matching (Linear Search)
- 🔁 Sort contacts:
  - By Name (using **Merge Sort**)
  - By Phone Number
  - By Number of Addresses
- 🧠 Efficient algorithm integration
- 🧱 Object-Oriented design using **inheritance**
- 📋 View and update contact details
- ☑️ Simple, menu-driven CLI interface
